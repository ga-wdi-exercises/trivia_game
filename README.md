##User Stories
___
* When I load the page, easy, medium and hard level buttons should be displayed
* When I click a level, a 60 second timer should begin and the first question should appear
* When I select an answer (either right or wrong), the next question should appear
* If I answer every question, or the timer runs out (whichever comes first), my score should pop up
* When I click 'ok' the easy, medium and hard level buttons should re-appear and I can select the level I'd like to play

##Unsolved Problems:
___
* I wanted to give the user an indication of whether or not their answers were correct as they were making a selection. Initially, I used alerts for this, but felt the user experience was negatively impacted by having to click ‘ok’ on the alert to move on to the next question. I wanted something to pop up and quickly disappear so the experience was not impacted.
* In addition to the timer and final score, I wanted to show the user which question they were on out of the total number of questions. (example: 7/15)
